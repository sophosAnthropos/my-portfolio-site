                My journey to become a software dev began two years ago, & I'm now a self taught Front End Web Developer. Having achieved proficiency in the front end, I have begun learning back end development to expand my repertoire. My hunger for knowledge is insatiable, & soon my fingers will be in all the programming pies.

                If you seek a valuable teammate look no further. I may be self taught, but I believe that no person is an island. During my time as analytical chemist I came to understand the value of team. Working with substances that continuously risked our wellbeing, bestowed upon me a strong foundation in clear & coherent communication.
